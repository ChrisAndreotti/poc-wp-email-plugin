# poc-wp-plugin

This project contains an experiment in learning how to build WordPress plugins. 

The project focused on building a plugin called the Snappy List Builder. Users of the plugin can create forms to capture new email subscribers, create custom downloads for opt-ins, and build unlimited subscriber lists.

Content and instructions came from the [Ultimate WordPress Plugin course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-plugin-course/)
